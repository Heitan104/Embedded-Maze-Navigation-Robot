# 🤖 Embedded Maze Navigation Robot (HCS12 Assembly)

An embedded systems project using the **HCS12 microcontroller** to program an autonomous robot that navigates a black-line maze using light sensors and wall detection. Written entirely in **assembly language**, the robot uses a finite state machine (FSM) to follow the line, avoid dead ends, and reach the maze's goal efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Light sensor-based black line detection and tracking  
- 🔁 FSM-driven navigation with real-time state transitions  
- 🧱 Wall detection and backtracking to avoid loops/dead ends  
- ⚡ Optimized performance:  
  - 90%+ on-track accuracy (up from ~60% after tuning)  
  - 50% reduction in idle states during maze traversal
