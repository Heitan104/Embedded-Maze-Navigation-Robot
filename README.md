# Embedded-Maze-Navigation-Robot
This project showcases a low-level embedded system programmed in HCS12 assembly to control an autonomous robot that navigates a black-line maze. Using light sensors and wall detection logic, the bot intelligently follows the line and backtracks when encountering dead endsâ€”ultimately finding its way to the maze's end.

ðŸ”§ Features
Light sensor-based line tracking with calibrated thresholds

Finite State Machine (FSM) for clean state management and navigation logic

Wall detection and directional backtracking to avoid dead ends

Performance optimization resulting in 90%+ line-following accuracy and reduced idle time

ðŸ›  Technologies
HCS12 Microcontroller

Assembly Language (ASM)

CodeWarrior IDE

FSM Design Principles

ðŸ‘¥ Team & Role
Developed in a group of 3. I led the design of the navigation logic and optimization of the state machine for improved performance and responsiveness.
